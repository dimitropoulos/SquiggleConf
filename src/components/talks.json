Come learn how to debug timeline based animations in the browser and share animation specs across teams!\n\nOften design happens in Figma and development happens in components. During that hand-off, motion and interaction design can fall through the cracks. But there are great tools and techniques that marry development and design, bringing life and personality to your UI.\n\nWe’ll start with the basics needed to add some visual interest to any project and escalate all the way to integrating complex, orchestrated animations from a motion design team into your workflow.  We’ll also cover CSS animation utility libraries, easing tools for creating custom eases and springs, using the web animations API to react to and chain animation events.",

A good post gets the information across in an orderly fashion. A great blog post starts from great source material, and manages to be a page turner. Sometimes, good is all you need, but it’s useful to recognize when you have the potential for great.\n\nNext, I’ll show real examples of specific edits to blog posts I consider good and great. In general, you need to first edit at the macro level (e.g. throwing out an entire first draft and choosing a completely different angle) and then the micro level (e.g. restructuring sentences for clarity). The title and opening deserve special attention, and I’ll share tactics you can use to write and refine them.\n\nMarketing your software isn’t just for marketers.
