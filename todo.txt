in a hurry - so taking notes here.

- need hover style on anchor tags
- fix TagLine.astro, for some reason it's not rending inline
- fix .full-mcs, for some reason the boxes are shrinking
- markdown rendering
  - styling for descriptions (i.e. ul/li)
  - role or qualifications links need to open a new tab
