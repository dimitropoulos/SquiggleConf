## styling issues

- fix weird cross-platform emoji
  - for link-out (under main hero)
    - added icon, but don't quite know how to do it in astro
  - link (for talk section titles)
    - added icon and replaced, but it hits the whole "anchor tag having a div child" thing

## mechanical issues

- change /talks to /sessions (?)
  - (partially done: just needs styling) front page `Talks` and `Workshops` should go to their respective sections on the /talks pages
- add section at top of /talks page to say that it's single-track
  - possibly replacing TagLine at the top
- FAQ
  - Schedule: add newsletter link
  - tickets: update for bulk purchasing
  - workshops: need to update paid mention, maybe also emphasize the "do not include"
- "use this train station"
  - bonus: small "I'm coming from NYC" section

## copy issues

- need description for Fatimah
- need to check description with Nick Nisi
- need to check description with Dan Vanderkam
- do a pass of session descriptions in notion to add links

## script issues

- italicize Effective TypeScript
