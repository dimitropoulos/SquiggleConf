## styling issues

- hack in normalize.css for p tags
- MOBILE
- (partially done: just needs styling) front page `Talks` and `Workshops` should go to their respective sections on the /talks pages
- is there a way to make the tags look less like buttons (?)
- speakers sections (i.e. Loris) can overflow their buttons
- travel map overflows on mobile
- fix weird cross-platform emoji
  - for link-out (under main hero)
    - added icon, but don't quite know how to do it in astro
  - link (for talk section titles)
    - added icon and replaced, but it hits the whole "anchor tag having a div child" thing

## mechanical issues

- change /talks to /sessions (?)
- add section at top of /talks page to say that it's single-track
  - possibly replacing TagLine at the top
- maybe put ~$350 Early Bird~ (or say "sold out") so it's clear that the $450 are the standard tickets
- bulk link sends you to the same buy page (not sure we can fix this?)
- FAQ
  - Schedule: add newsletter link
  - tickets: update for bulk purchasing
  - workshops: need to update paid mention, maybe also emphasize the "do not include"
- "use this train station"
  - bonus: small "I'm coming from NYC" section

## copy issues

- need description for Fatimah
- need to check description with Nick Nisi
- do a pass of session descriptions in notion to add links
